# 🌟 Skin Disease Detection using ML + Telegram Bot 🤖📱
🎯 Goal: Build a smart, user-friendly interface to detect skin diseases using a Machine Learning model trained on the DermaNet dataset — seamlessly integrated with a Telegram bot for fast and familiar access!

# 🔬 ML Model Overview
We used a robust Convolutional Neural Network trained on the DermaNet dataset 🧠 to accurately classify skin diseases. This model was then connected to a Telegram bot, turning complex AI predictions into a simple chat-based experience — no tech skills needed! 🙌

# 📌 ML Model Reference:
Kaggle Notebook – Skin Disease Classification
📁 Train & Test Dataset

# 🛠️ How to Set It Up
💻 Open ML_Model.ipynb in your favorite editor (we recommend Jupyter Notebook).

📥 Download the dataset from the link above.

🧪 Train your model — if you're short on time, focus on a few diseases to start with.

💾 Once training is done, save the trained model (.pkl or .h5) on your local device.

🔍 Open telegram_bot_interface.py and set the path to your saved model file.

🤖 Create a Telegram Bot via @BotFather and get your API key.

🔑 Paste the API key into the Python script.

▶️ Run the script, and you’re ready to go!

💬 Head to Telegram, start chatting with your bot, and upload skin images for predictions.

🌐 Skin Disease Prediction Web Application 🧑‍⚕️💻
This project also features a full web-based application where users can upload skin condition images and receive instant AI-powered predictions! Perfect for both medical professionals and curious users.

# ✨ Key Features:
📸 Image Upload: Drop your skin lesion image for quick diagnosis.

🤖 Smart ML Integration: Behind the scenes, a trained model analyzes your image.

📊 Results with Confidence Scores: Know what the AI sees, and how sure it is.

🎨 User-Friendly UI: Clean, responsive design for all devices – desktop or mobile!

🔐 Privacy First: Secure handling of your uploaded images.

# 🧰 Tech Stack:
Front-End: HTML, CSS, JavaScript ⚙️

Back-End: Python, Flask 🔁

Machine Learning: Trained CNN on DermaNet dataset 🧠

Deployment Options: Can be hosted on platforms like Heroku, Render, or even locally.

# 🌈 Purpose & Impact:
Our aim is to empower users with early skin disease detection through accessible AI tools. Whether it's a mole that looks suspicious or a rash you're unsure about — a simple photo upload can guide your next step toward medical consultation.

💡 This is AI for Good — blending healthcare with intelligent systems to make diagnostics faster, smarter, and more accessible. Whether you're a developer 👩‍💻 or a concerned user 👨‍⚕️, this tool opens the door to modern, efficient health tech solutions.

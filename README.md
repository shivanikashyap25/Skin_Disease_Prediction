Steps to follow :

- open the ML_Model file in editor of your choice(i used jupyter notebook)
- download datasets from above links
- train your model(if you need it done quickly train it for a few diseases)
- after training completes save the ml model in your device
- open telegram_bot_interface.py and specifiy the path to the ML model saved in your device
- go to telegram, create a bot and get the api key
- paste the api key and run the python script 
- go to your telegram and start the bot
